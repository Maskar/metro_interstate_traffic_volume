# Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Prediction using LSTM

The project aims to predict the volume of traffic flow between Minneapolis and St. Paul at a specific point in Minnesota. My task is to build a multi-step RNN with LSTM model that makes a single prediction point of the traffic volume 2 hours into the future, given the previous 6-hour window.
